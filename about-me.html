      <h4>My name is Ashley McDowell. I currently attend Iowa State University for Advertising with a minor in Business & German. Here are some facts about me! &#9733;</h4>
      <p><br>&#128247; I am a <i>photographer, graphic designer,</i> &amp; <i>web developer</i>. <br><br>&#129504; I am self-taught in all three, but especially in web development, so I probably missed a few steps. Hence why I am here!<br><br>&#127838;&amp;&#127846;&#61;&#10060;  I am gluten and dairy intolerant (it's okay to feel sorry for me, I feel sorry for myself whenever I smell cinnimon rolls).<br><br>&#9917; I used to play soccer and then I went to college...we will have a February 30th before you see me at a gym<br><br>&#128568; I have three cats. The one pictured below is Rook. He is my modal due to his majestic mustache</p>
