      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>My name is Ashley McDowell. I currently attend Iowa State University. I am a photographer, graphic designer, & web developer, but I am self-taught so I probably missed a few steps. Hence why I am here!<br>I am gluten and dairy intolerant (it's okay to mourn, I do too whenever I smell cinnimon rolls).<br> I used to play soccer then I went to college...we will have a February 30th before you see me at the gym<br>I have three cats. The one pictured below is Rook. He is my modal due to his majestic mustache</p>
